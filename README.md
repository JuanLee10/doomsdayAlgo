# doomsdayAlgo

I am excited to showcase my React Native project which aims to provide information about the Doomsday Algorithm.

## Motivation
<!-- A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists. -->

Wanting to learn more about React Native and to spread awareness about the doomsday algorithm. 

<!-- ## Build status
Build status of continus integration i.e. travis, appveyor etc. Ex. - 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akashnimare/foco.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/akashnimare/foco)
[![Windows Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/akashnimare/foco?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/akashnimare/foco/branch/master)

## Code style
If you're using any code style like xo, standard etc. That will help others while contributing to your project. Ex. -

## Screenshots
Include logo/demo screenshot etc. -->

## Tech/framework used

### Built with
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/client)
- [Animated API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/animations)

## Features
The application allows users to input their birthday and figure out what day of the week they were born on from years 1100+. Then it gives the users an 
detailed explanation for how the calculation can be done in their own heads.

## How to use?
In order to host the project locally, follow these steps in your own terminal.

    git clone https://github.com/JuanLee10/doomsdayAlgo.git
    cd doomsdayAlgo
    npm install
    npm start

Afterwards press i for ios or a for android. I used expo go and iphone simulator from xcode.

## Future directions


<!-- 

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contribute

Let people know how they can contribute into your project. A [contributing guideline](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be a big plus.

## Credits
Give proper credits. This could be a link to any repo which inspired you to build this project, any blogposts or links to people who contrbuted in this project.
